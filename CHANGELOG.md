## v0.2.0

Thanks for contributing to this release:

[@lread](https://github.com/lread), [@patrick-galvin](https://github.com/patrick-galvin), [@SevereOverfl0w](https://github.com/SevereOverfl0w), [@djblue](https://github.com/djblue), [@kwrooijen](https://github.com/kwrooijen), [@sogaiu](https://github.com/sogaiu), [@joinr](https://github.com/joinr), [@RickMoynihan](https://github.com/RickMoynihan), [@galdober](https://github.com/galdober)

### Breaking changes

- Removed `:realize-max` and `:preset :termination-safe`. In the light of
  [#348](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/348) it would be misleading to
  claim that sci can guarantee termination within reasonable time.

### New

- Add `class?`, `iterator-seq`, `remove-watch`, `realized?`, `clojure.walk/macroexpand-all`, `find-var`, `lazy-cat`, `bound?`, `*print-namespace-maps*`, `get-thread-bindings`, `var-get`, `var-set`, `with-local-vars`
- Add `fork` API function [#369](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/369)
- Add API functions for parsing code and evaluating forms: `sci.core/reader`,
  `sci.core/parse-string`, `sci.core/parse-next`, `sci.core/eval-form` [#404](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/404)
- Support implementing `IDeref`, `IAtom`, `IAtom2` (and CLJS equivalents) [#401](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/401)
- Add API vars `print-meta`, `print-level` which can be used with
  `sci.core/binding` to control the dynamic var equivalent in sci programs
- Support calling `symbol` on a var [#453](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/453)
- `:disable-arity-checks` option: when used, sci behaves similarly to CLJS/JS by
  not checking the provided number of arguments and allowing less or more for
  single and fixed arity functions
  [#460](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/460)

## Prior to v0.1.0

Details about releases prior to v0.1.0 can be found
[here](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/releases).

## Breaking changes

### 0.2.4

-  Do not merge ex-data into sci error [#534](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/534)

### >= 0.1.0

- Removed `:realize-max` and `:preset :termination-safe`. In the light of
  [#348](https://github.com/borkdude/sci/issues/348) it would be misleading to
  claim that sci can guarantee termination within reasonable time.

### v0.0.12

- `:row` and `:col` metadata have been renamed to `:line` and `:column` to be
  more compatible with Clojure.

### v0.0.11

- macros provided via options (functions marked with `:sci/macro` metadata) now
  have two additional arguments at the start: `&env` and `&form`.
